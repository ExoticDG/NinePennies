## Could you rewrite the code within the #src folder (#sym:calculate, #sym:cli, and #sym:main) into a Python program capible of running on 32 bit systems wilth little RAM? The result should be put into the #/AI_Rewrites/Python folder

 main
 cli
Of course. I will rewrite the Rust code from the src folder into a Python program. The resulting file will be placed in the Python directory.

Read main.rs

Read cli.rs

Read calculate.rs

Of course. I will rewrite the Rust code from the src folder into a single Python script. This script will be functionally equivalent to the original Rust application, designed to be lightweight and compatible with 32-bit systems with limited RAM. The resulting file will be placed in the Python directory.

First, I will analyze the existing Rust files (main.rs, cli.rs, and calculate.rs) to understand the complete program logic. Then, I will translate that logic into a single, efficient Python script.

Created main.py

Of course. I will rewrite the Rust code from your src folder into a single, memory-efficient Python script and place it in the Python directory. This script will be suitable for running on systems with limited resources.

I have created the Python script at main.py. It replicates the functionality of your original Rust program while being optimized for lower memory usage. You can run it from your terminal to see the results.


## Is there a way to remove the f prefix in the print commands? The program wont run on the desierd device (TI 84 Plus CE Python) with them.

Of course. The f prefix is for f-strings, a feature that isn't supported in all Python environments, especially on devices like the TI-84. I will rewrite the Python script to use the .format() method for string formatting, which is more widely compatible.

NinePennies.py+1-1
NinePennies.py+4-2
NinePennies.py+1-1
NinePennies.py+1-1
NinePennies.py+7-7
Yes, of course. The f prefix denotes an f-string, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.6. To make the code compatible with older Python versions or environments that don't support f-strings, like the TI-84 Plus CE, I can replace them with the .format() method.

I have updated the NinePennies.py file to remove all f-strings. The program's logic remains the same, but it should now be compatible with the Python environment on your calculator.


## It still dosent work, but it nolonger gives an error so that change probebly helped. I have included the example scripts as referances that do work.

Of course. It seems the Python environment on the TI-84 Plus CE is more limited than a standard Python installation. The fact that it's no longer erroring out but still not working suggests we're running into resource limits (like memory) or using unsupported language features that don't cause explicit errors.

Based on the working examples you provided, I can see a few key differences:

No sys module: The sys.exit() command is likely not supported.
No Dictionaries: The examples use lists and simple variables, but not dictionaries ({}).
No if __name__ == "__main__":: The scripts run from top to bottom.
Memory Efficiency: My previous script created a potentially large list in memory, which the calculator might not be able to handle.
I will rewrite the script to address these points. The new version will not use any modules, dictionaries, or the if __name__ == "__main__" block. Most importantly, I will change the calculation logic to be much more memory-efficient by not creating the large intermediate list.

Here are the changes for NinePennies.py.

NinePennies.py+64-49
NinePennies.py+3-0
Thank you for the reference scripts. It's very helpful to see what works on your device. The issue is likely related to memory usage or unsupported Python features on the TI-84's specific Python environment.

The most probable cause is that the script creates a list in memory (result_sequence) that can become very large, consuming too much RAM on the calculator. The example scripts you provided don't create large data structures in the same way.

I will rewrite the core logic to be much more memory-efficient by avoiding the creation of that list. I'll also remove some other features, like dictionaries and the sys module, which might not be fully supported, to make the script simpler and more robust for your device.

I have applied the following changes to NinePennies.py:

Optimized Memory Usage: The calculate_first_query function no longer creates a large list. It now calculates the character counts directly, which uses a constant, tiny amount of memory regardless of the sequence length.
Removed Dictionaries: I've removed the use of dictionaries (char_map) to simplify the code, passing character data directly to the functions that need it.
Removed sys.exit(): The script no longer uses the sys module to exit, which is a more compatible approach.
The updated script should now run correctly on your TI-84 Plus CE.
